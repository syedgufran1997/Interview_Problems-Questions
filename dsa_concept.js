// Data Structures

// It is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

// 1. Array methods
// push , pop , shift, unshift
// map , filter, sort, reduce, concat, slice, splice

// 2. objects

// 3. stacks DS - LIFO

// 4. Queue DS - FIFO
// Enqueue - Which add an element to the tail of the collection
// Dequeue - Which removes an element from the head of the collection

// 5. Linked List DS
// It is a linear data structure that consists of Nodes,
// Each node contains data and pointer to the next node in the list.
// First node is called head and last is tail
// Singly linked list and doubly linked list

// 6. Hash Table
// A hash table is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs

// 7. Tree Data Structure
// A tree is hyrarchical Data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
// a tree is a non linear DS, tree will not contain any loops and cycles
// Binary search tree (BST) - A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each
// node has at most 2 children, they are refered to as left child and right child.

// BST operations are
// Insertion
// search
// DFS and BFS
// Deletion

// DFS - Depth First search
// PreOrder traversal - start from root and left sub tree go back and right sub tree
// InOrder traversal - start from left sub tree and go back and right then got back to root if no sub trees
// Postorder traversal - sart from left and right siling then parent and root

// BFS - Breadth First searh

// Graph - A graph is non linear Data structure that consists of a finite number
// of vertices connected by edges.

// Directed graphs(one direction) - A graph in which the edges have a direction
// Undirected Graphs(By directional) - A graph in which the edges are bidirectional and no arrows
// use cases
// google maps, social media sites
