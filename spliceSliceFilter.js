// Difference between splice, slice and filter array method in Javascript

// Splice
// A JS method which modifies the original array by adding, removing or replacing elements

// Slice
// A JS method which creates a shallow copy of an array without modifying the original array

// Filter
// Creates a new array containing all elements that pass a test provided by a function,
// without modifying the original array
